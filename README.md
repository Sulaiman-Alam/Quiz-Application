# ThinkStorm - A Quiz Application to Help Build Full Stack Knowledge

## Overview

Hey there! Welcome to ThinkStorm! This is a collaborative project where we use HTML/CSS and JavaScript (Node.js) to design and create a beginner full stack project. This proejct entails a quiz application which randomly choose questions (currently obtaining questions from a json file) and outputs them to the users to answer. Afterwards, where the user will get a score of how many they got correct. 

With regards to technologies used, we currently have HTML/CSS for the frontend and JavaScript (Node.js) for the backend and for running the server. Alongside this, we have used technologies such as BootStrap and CHATGPT to obtain and refine various portions of the code. 

## Features

Our Quiz application currently chooses questions, from a pre-filled json file, and each question features a timer for answering them. Additionally, this application also stores users and their scores in another json file, and then uses it to update a live leaderboard.  

## How to Access and Run the Server

To access the code, these steps can be used (Note, to access the code VS Code is recommended):
1. On the Github Repository first go under the Code Tab
2. Click on the blue Code button and in the dropdown click on "Download Zip"
3. Once the Zip file downloads, extract all the items from the folder and then run the page!

To run the server on VS Code:
1. Once the contents of the Zip File have been extracted in VS Code
2. Locate tehe server.js file and run that js file
3. Once it is running, go to your favored browser and type "LocalHost:3500" in the url
4. Then the page should be running!

## Next Steps

Given that this is only a beginner project, our hope is to in the future expand it even further with new updates. For example, after we get the first version running, next we intend to use Express.js to streamline the process of running the server.
